# We define a harmounious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is exactly 1.
#
# Now, given an integer array, you need to find the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].
#
#
# Â 
#
# Note: The length of the input array will not exceed 20,000.
